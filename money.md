How are we going to make money? Most of our services are free for people to use. It's free to sign up and free to find information about the event you're interested in. When new users join and submit their preferences, the system searches for matches through the database. That matching is also free. The system is sending notifications to all matched participants and gives them the ability to organize free event themselves. But not all events are free. When there's a need for a paid instructor, coach or organiser, we will find such an expert, and we take cut from his participation fees. We also have established [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/teambldr) system to accept donations from people who like what we do and want to support us. That's where we start. We will look into other sources of revenue when our network grow. We want to build a product which delivers value to its users. And if we succeed and we get good participation numbers there will be a way to get revenue to support the system and people involved in running and maintaining it. First, we focus on early adopters. We need to learn from them and see what data they provide to us and how we can serve them better. We will build on that feedback. We're constantly reviewing incoming data to better organise and format it to suit success of the system. If you'd like to share your idea or feedback, please send me an email at azhidkov@gmail.com
